abstract="Adaptive streaming has recently emerged as a technology enabling high-quality streaming at various bitrates. One of the video streaming challenges remains in research topic nowadays that is choosing optimal segment base on network characteristics and streaming devices, such as network bandwidth, latency, the computational capacities of devices. Researchers have proposed many algorithms to overcome such issues within their predefined conditions. However, those proposed methods do not perform efficiently in the heterogeneous network today. Consequently, in this article, we present research on a context-aware adaptive algorithm for ambient intelligence dynamic adaptive employing mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, we apply deep learning in the adaptive algorithm which is installed at the MEC to assist clients in choosing the optimal streaming segments as well as reduce network latency. Furthermore, we apply the multilayer perceptron classifier with data obtained from various experiments of adaptive streaming algorithms then combine them in a general algorithm. In the analysis, we use network simulator NS3 as a tool to carry out the verification of our proposed method. As a result, the proposed research reduces network latency as well as improve quality streaming compared to existing approaches.",

Optimal cache and Virtual Machine (VM) placement and migration, and optimal routing based on several new constraints such as system load, network infrastructure, user satisfaction and migration cost is designed. Extensive evaluations and comparison to state of the art techniques are carried out. The results show that our cache techniques outperform other solutions and give better satisfaction to the three constituents: users, network operators and content providers."

ABSTRACT = {A wide range of multimedia services is expected to be offered for mobile users via various wireless access networks. Even the integration of Cloud Computing in such networks does not support an adequate Quality of Experience (QoE) in areas with high demands for multimedia contents. Fog computing has been conceptualized to facilitate the deployment of new services that cloud computing cannot provide, particularly those demanding QoE guarantees. These services are provided using fog nodes located at the network edge, which is capable of virtualizing their functions/applications. Service migration from the cloud to fog nodes can be actuated by request patterns and the timing issues. To the best of our knowledge, existing works on fog computing focus on architecture and fog node deployment issues. In this article, we describe the operational impacts and benefits associated with service migration from the cloud to multi-tier fog computing for video distribution with QoE support. Besides that, we perform the evaluation of such service migration of video services. Finally, we present potential research challenges and trends.},

abstract="Recent developments in telecommunications have allowed drawing new paradigms, including the Internet of Everything, to provide services by the interconnection of different physical devices enabling the exchange of data to enrich and automate people's daily activities; and Fog computing, which is an extension of the well-known Cloud computing, bringing tasks to the edge of the network exploiting characteristics such as lower latency, mobility support, and location awareness. Combining these paradigms opens a new set of possibilities for innovative services and applications; however, it also brings a new complex scenario that must be efficiently managed to properly fulfill the needs of the users. In this scenario, the Fog Orchestrator component is the key to coordinate the services in the middle of Cloud computing and Internet of Everything. In this paper, key challenges in the development of the Fog Orchestrator to support the Internet of Everything are identified, including how they affect the tasks that a Fog service Orchestrator should perform. Furthermore, different service Orchestrator architectures for the Fog are explored and analyzed in order to identify how the previously listed challenges are being tackled. Finally, a discussion about the open challenges, technological directions, and future of the research on this subject is presented.",
